# Build a Quiz (Python)
Develop a computer program (Level 1)

## Instructions
1. Create 10 questions from the Bible with multiple options.
2. Figure the step by step process of your program for the Quiz. (e.g. What happens first? What happens after if they type the correct answer?). Think of all the cases that might happen (e.g. if the user enters a number instead of a string). Check with your teacher before moving on to step 3.
3. Write pseudocode for how your program will run. Pseudocode is an informal language which explains how the algorithms will work. This can simply be done in a txt file in this repository. Check with your teacher before moving to step 4.
4. Create a python file (main.py) and begin coding your quiz. Your quiz needs to include: variables, input from a user, and data stored in collections (e.g. lists). Functions are optional. Don't forget to include comments that explains what is happening in your code.
